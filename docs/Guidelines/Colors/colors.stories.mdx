# Colors

Color is an intrinsic element
of our brand. Not only does it
contribute to the look and feel
of our brand identity, it also
creates a canvas on which we
can express ourselves.

Even though we can never truly own any one
of our brand colors, the way we apply them
has become an ownable expression that is
recognised by our community.

TicketSwap uses colors purposefully to
communicate how things function in the
interface.

Our color palette is created with the vision
of feeling safe, be trusted, clear and friendly
towards our users. Instead of hex codes we
use human friendly names, so itâ€™s clear for all
employees what colour is used.
