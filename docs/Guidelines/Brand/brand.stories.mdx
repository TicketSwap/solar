## Manifesto

The passion and enthusiasm the founders and
the employees of TicketSwap have for music,
dance, culture, arts, sports and any talent-filled
entertainment is what drives our machine.
That’s why we are fans for the fans. We want to
cultivate the spices of life we get from watching
our favorite singer on stage, our favorite DJ in an
underground club, and favorite ballerina taking
flight. When tickets to events sell-out, we are
there to help you find second-hand tickets.
When you can’t see your favorite concert
because something unexpectedly turns up,
we help you find another fan in common who
will buy your ticket from you and enjoy the show
as much as you would have.
We combine our passion for fans and music
events with our own technology to create a fair,
honest and safe place for people to resell their
tickets online. By placing a selling-limit of no
more than 20% above the original ticket price,
we aim to stop profiteering, fraud, keep ticket
reselling fair, and help those fans who want to go
to an event without getting ripped off.

We started TicketSwap with simplicity in mind.
Our platform will remain as simple as possible
for anyone to enter the site, buy sell and place
wanted listings for second-hand tickets.

Our business values will remain being customer-
driven, honest, safe, transparent, and simple.

The journey we are on is not only to pursue
technological advances and business growth:
we want to change the world. By this we mean
we will stick to our values in order to change
the way the world sees the secondary ticketing
industry: we will bring fairness to the market,
and we will continue to lobby policy-makers,
sit with event organizers, engage with artists
and preach the gospel of ticketing to the fans.
After all, we are fans too.
Sound ambitious? Always.
We will never rest until the world knows
TicketSwap is here for you, the fans.

## Vision

We’re in business to make the lives of fans better.

## Tone of voice

The way we are positioned, shows the world
exactly why we are different than others.
TicketSwap’s mission is to be the safest and
fairest way to buy and sell secondhand tickets.
TicketSwap believes the secondary ticket market
should be about providing fans with a safe way
to recoup the money they’ve paid for tickets they
can no longer use. In its current state, real fans
aren’t getting a fair shot at buying tickets and
being priced out of attending events altogether.

TicketSwap’s stance is simple and focuses on
empowering consumers: the best way to beat touts
is to create an alternative that is fairer, safer and
more transparent. TicketSwap carefully chooses its
partners and is always open for collaborations that
could make the online ticketing world safer.
You’ll find this state of mind in the employees that
work at our head office in Amsterdam, or remote
in different countries. We all have a clear vision of
how real fans should be treated, because we’ve all
been in that situation where there was room for a
lot of improvement. It’s why we tackled it and made
it our priority.

We believe that our communication should be
on the same level as those who we’re speaking
with, no matter what language they use.
Transparency should be at the core of all our
messaging.

Our voice is our users voice and it’s key in our
social media efforts. We try to stay relevant with a
hint of cheekiness, participating in trending topics
with our own unique take on them.
The tone of voice in all communication is informal,
but correct. When situations require you to be
formal, that is not a problem.
